# 11ASE Task 1 2025 - [INSERT NAME OF APPLICATION]

#### By Victor Guo

## Requirements Definition
### Functional Requirements
* **Data Retrieval:** What does the user need to be able to view in the system?\
 The user needs to be able to choose what data to delete.
* **User Interface:** What is required for the user to interact with the system?\
 The ability to click on buttons and read text is needed to use the program (and an extremely beefy pc).
* **Data Display:** What information does the user need to obtain from the system?\
 The User must be able to read the data from the API but not be able to change without permission.
### Non-Functional Requirements
* **Performance:** How well does the system need to perform?\
 The system requirements are an RTX 5090 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D or equivalent, this program is going to be extremely difficult to run (this is a joke). This program needs to run smoothly on even the oldest devices (the test will be my MacBook Air from 2013, an 11 year old machine which struggles to run the browser). Performance should be maintained when using different platforms, so the user can user is confident that they can run it on their computer.
* **Reliability:** How reliable does the system and data need to be?\
 The system needs to be extremely reliable as the 5090 and the 7800X3D are at risk of failure (again, this is a joke). Although the system actually does need to be extremely reliable as the user's data is a top priority and must not be leaked, so the system needs to be extremely reliable and store the data securely on all operating systems, and must not be flagged as insecure on any of them. This way the user who is going to install the application can be sure that they are not harming their computer.
* **Usability and Accessibility:** How easy to navigate does the system need to be?
 What instructions will we need for users to access the system?\
  The system needs to be easy to navigate so that people who are not very familiar with computers can easily understand how it works. All there will need to be is a how to file showing what each button leads to. This program will also need to work on all desktop operating systems (will test using Windows, MacOS and Main Linux Kernels).

## Determining Specifications
### Functional Specifications
What does the system actually NEED to do?

User Requirements

What does the user need to be able to do? List all specifications here.

Inputs & Outputs

What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?

Core Features

At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?

User Interaction

How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?

Error Handling

What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?
### Non-Functional Specifications
What would improve the system but is ultimately not required?

Performance

How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?

Useability / Accessibility

How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?

Reliability

What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Duplicate data? API retrieval crash?
